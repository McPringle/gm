    summary: "Gum is a Gradle/Maven wrapper written in Go"
    description: |
      Gum is a Gradle/Maven wrapper written in Go, inspired in https://github.com/dougborg/gdub and https://github.com/srs/gw.
      Gum automatically detects if the project is Gradle or Maven based and runs the appropriate command. However in the case
      that Gum guesses wrong you can force a specific build tool to be used.

      **Usage**

      Gum supports the following flags

      * **-gd** displays debug information
      * **-gg** force Gradle build
      * **-gh** displays help information
      * **-gm** force Maven build
      * **-gn** executes nearest build file
      * **-gq** run gm in quiet mode
      * **-gv** displays version information

      Gum will execute the build based on the root build file unless **-gn** is specified, in which case the nearest build file
      will be selected. If a specific build file is given (**-b**, **--build-file** for Gradle; **-f**, **--file** for Maven)
      then that file will be used instead.
